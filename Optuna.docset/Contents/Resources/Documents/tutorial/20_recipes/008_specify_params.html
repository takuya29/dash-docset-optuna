<p>It’s natural that you have some specific sets of hyperparameters to try first such as initial learning rate
values and the number of leaves.
Also, it’s possible that you’ve already tried those sets before having Optuna find better
sets of hyperparameters.</p>
<p>Optuna provides two APIs to support such cases:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Passing those sets of hyperparameters and let Optuna evaluate them - <a class="reference internal" href="../../reference/generated/optuna.study.Study.html#optuna.study.Study.enqueue_trial" title="optuna.study.Study.enqueue_trial"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enqueue_trial()</span></code></a></p></li>

<p>In this scenario, let’s assume you have some out-of-box sets of hyperparameters but have not
evaluated them yet and decided to use Optuna to find better sets of hyperparameters.</p>
<p>Optuna has <a class="reference internal" href="../../reference/generated/optuna.study.Study.html#optuna.study.Study.enqueue_trial" title="optuna.study.Study.enqueue_trial"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">optuna.study.Study.enqueue_trial()</span></code></a> which lets you pass those sets of
hyperparameters to Optuna and Optuna will evaluate them.</p>

<p>In this scenario, let’s assume you have some out-of-box sets of hyperparameters and
you have already evaluated them but the results are not desirable so that you are thinking of
using Optuna.</p>
<p>Optuna has <a class="reference internal" href="../../reference/generated/optuna.study.Study.html#optuna.study.Study.add_trial" title="optuna.study.Study.add_trial"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">optuna.study.Study.add_trial()</span></code></a> which lets you register those results
to Optuna and then Optuna will sample hyperparameters taking them into account.</p>
<p>In this section,  the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">objective</span></code> is the same as the first scenario.</p>
