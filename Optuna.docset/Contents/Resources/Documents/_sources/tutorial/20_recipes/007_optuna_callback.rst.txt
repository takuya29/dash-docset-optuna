Callback for Study.optimize
===========================

This tutorial showcases how to use & implement Optuna ``Callback`` for :func:`~optuna.study.Study.optimize`.

``Callback`` is called after every evaluation of ``objective``, and
it takes :class:`~optuna.study.Study` and :class:`~optuna.trial.FrozenTrial` as arguments, and does some work.

`MLflowCallback <https://optuna-integration.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/optuna_integration.MLflowCallback.html>`__ is a great example.

Stop optimization after some trials are pruned in a row
-------------------------------------------------------

This example implements a stateful callback which stops the optimization
if a certain number of trials are pruned in a row.
The number of trials pruned in a row is specified by ``threshold``.

    import optuna


    class StopWhenTrialKeepBeingPrunedCallback:
        def __init__(self, threshold: int):
            self.threshold = threshold
            self._consequtive_pruned_count = 0

        def __call__(self, study: optuna.study.Study, trial: optuna.trial.FrozenTrial) -> None:
            if trial.state == optuna.trial.TrialState.PRUNED:
                self._consequtive_pruned_count += 1
            else:
                self._consequtive_pruned_count = 0

            if self._consequtive_pruned_count >= self.threshold:
                study.stop()

This objective prunes all the trials except for the first 5 trials (``trial.number`` starts with 0).

    def objective(trial):
        if trial.number > 4:
            raise optuna.TrialPruned

        return trial.suggest_float("x", 0, 1)

Here, we set the threshold to ``2``: optimization finishes once two trials are pruned in a row.
So, we expect this study to stop after 7 trials.

As you can see in the log above, the study stopped after 7 trials as expected.
