Introduced from Optuna v3.3, this module finds a broad range of applications, such as utilizing snapshots of large size\nmodels for hyperparameter tuning, optimizing massive chemical structures, and even human-in-the-loop optimization employing images\nor sounds. Use of Optuna's artifact module allows you to handle data that would be too large to store in a database. Furthermore,\nby integrating with [optuna-dashboard](https://github.com/optuna/optuna-dashboard)_, saved artifacts can be automatically visualized\nwith the web UI, which significantly reduces the effort of experiment management.\n\n## TL;DR\n\n- The artifact module provides a simple way to save and use large data associated with trials.\n\n- Saved artifacts can be visualized just by accessing the web page using optuna-dashboard, and downloading is also easy.\n\n- Thanks to the abstraction of the artifact module, the backend (file system, AWS S3) can be easily switched.\n\n- As the artifact module is tightly linked with Optuna, experiment management can be completed with the Optuna ecosystem alone, simplifying the code base.\n\n## Concepts\n\n.. list-table::\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - Fig 1. Concepts of the \"artifact\".\n    * - .. image:: https://github.com/optuna/optuna/assets/38826298/112e0b75-9d22-474b-85ea-9f3e0d75fa8d\n\nAn \"artifact\" is associated with an Optuna trial. In Optuna, the objective function is evaluated sequentially to search for the\nmaximum (or minimum) value. Each evaluation of the sequentially repeated objective function is called a trial. Normally, trials and\ntheir associated attributes are saved via storage objects to files or RDBs, etc. For experiment management, you can also save and\nuse :attr:`optuna.trial.Trial.user_attrs` for each trial. However, these attributes are assumed to be integers, short strings, or other small data, which\nare not suitable for storing large data. With Optuna's artifact module, users can save large data (such as model snapshots,\nchemical structures, image and audio data, etc.) for each trial.\n\nAlso, while this tutorial does not touch upon it, it's possible to manage artifacts associated not only with trials but also with\nstudies. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/optuna.artifacts.upload_artifact.html)_\nif you are interested in.\n\n## Situations where artifacts are useful\n\nArtifacts are useful when you want to save data that is too large to be stored in RDB for each trial. For example, the artifact\nmodule would be handy in situations like the following:\n\n- Saving snapshots of machine learning models: Suppose you are tuning hyperparameters for a large-scale machine learning model like\n  an LLM. The model is very large, and each round of learning (which corresponds to one trial in Optuna) takes time. To prepare for\n  unexpected incidents during training (such as blackouts at the data center or a preemption of computation jobs by the scheduler),\n  you may want to save snapshots of the model in the middle of training for each trial. These snapshots often tend to be large and\n  are more suitable to be saved as some kinds of files than to be stored in RDB. In such cases, the artifact module is useful.\n\n- Optimizing chemical structures: Suppose you are formulating and exploring a problem of finding stable chemical structures as a\n  black-box optimization problem. Evaluating one chemical structure corresponds to one trial in Optuna, and that chemical structure\n  is a complex and large one. It is not appropriate to store such chemical structure data in RDB. It is conceivable to save the\n  chemical structure data in a specific file format, and in such a case, the artifact module is useful.\n\n- Human-in-the-loop optimization of images: Suppose you are optimizing prompts for a generative model that outputs images. You\n  sample the prompts using Optuna, output images using the generative model, and let humans rate the images for a Human-in-the-loop\n  optimization process. Since the output images are large data, it is not appropriate to use RDB to store them, and in such cases,\n  using the artifact module is well suited.\n\n## How Trials and Artifacts are Recorded\n\nAs explained so far, the artifact module is useful when you want to save large data for each trial. In this section, we explain\nhow artifacts work in the following two scenarios: first when SQLite + local file system-based artifact backend is used\n(suitable when the entire optimization cycle is completed locally), and second when MySQL + AWS S3-based artifact backend is used\n(suitable when you want to keep the data in a remote location).\n\n### Scenario 1: SQLite + file system-based artifact store\n\n.. list-table::\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - Fig 2. SQLite + file system-based artifact store.\n    * - .. image:: https://github.com/optuna/optuna/assets/38826298/d41d042e-6b78-4615-bf96-05f73a47e9ea\n\nFirst, we explain a simple case where the optimization is completed locally.\n\nNormally, Optuna's optimization history is persisted into some kind of a database via storage objects. Here, let's consider a\nmethod using SQLite, a lightweight RDB management system, as the backend. With SQLite, data is stored in a single file (e.g.,\n``./example.db``). The optimization history comprises what parameters were sampled in each trial, what the evaluation values for those\nparameters were, when each trial started and ended, etc. This file is in the SQLite format, and it is not suitable for storing\nlarge data. Writing large data entries may cause performance degradation. Note that SQLite is not suitable for distributed parallel\noptimization. If you want to perform that, please use MySQL as we will explain later, or :class:`~optuna.storages.JournalStorage`.\n\nSo, let's use the artifact module to save large data in a different format. Suppose the data is generated for each trial and you\nwant to save it in some format (e.g., png format if it's an image). The specific destination for saving the artifacts can be any\ndirectory on the local file system (e.g., the ``./artifacts`` directory). When defining the objective function, you only need to save\nand reference the data using the artifact module.\n\nThe simple pseudocode for the above case  would look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nimport optuna\nfrom optuna.artifacts import FileSystemArtifactStore\nfrom optuna.artifacts import upload_artifact\nfrom optuna.artifacts import download_artifact\n\n\nbase_path = \"./artifacts\"\nos.makedirs(base_path, exist_ok=True)\nartifact_store = FileSystemArtifactStore(base_path=base_path)\n\n\ndef objective(trial: optuna.Trial) -> float:\n    ... = trial.suggest_float(\"x\", -10, 10)\n\n    # Creating and writing an artifact.\n    file_path = generate_example(...)  # This function returns some kind of file.\n    artifact_id = upload_artifact(\n        artifact_store=artifact_store,\n        file_path=file_path,\n        study_or_trial=trial,\n    )  # The return value is the artifact ID.\n    trial.set_user_attr(\n        \"artifact_id\", artifact_id\n    )  # Save the ID in RDB so that it can be referenced later.\n\n    return ...\n\n\nstudy = optuna.create_study(study_name=\"test_study\", storage=\"sqlite:///example.db\")\nstudy.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)\n\n# Downloading artifacts associated with the best trial.\nbest_artifact_id = study.best_trial.user_attrs.get(\"artifact_id\")\ndownload_file_path = ...  # Set the path to save the downloaded artifact.\ndownload_artifact(\n    artifact_store=artifact_store, file_path=download_file_path, artifact_id=best_artifact_id\n)\nwith open(download_file_path, \"rb\") as f:\n    content = f.read().decode(\"utf-8\")\nprint(content)\n```\n### Scenario 2: Remote MySQL RDB server + AWS S3 artifact store\n\n.. list-table::\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - Fig 3. Remote MySQL RDB server + AWS S3 artifact store.\n    * - .. image:: https://github.com/optuna/optuna/assets/38826298/067efc85-1fad-4b46-a2be-626c64439d7b\n\nNext, we explain the case where data is read and written remotely.\n\nAs the scale of optimization increases, it becomes difficult to complete all calculations locally. Optuna's storage objects can\npersist data remotely by specifying a URL, enabling distributed optimization. Here, we will use MySQL as a remote relational\ndatabase server. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system and a well-known software used for various purposes.\nFor using MySQL with Optuna, the [tutorial](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/10_key_features/004_distributed.html)_\ncan be a good reference. However, it is also not appropriate to read and write large data in a relational database like MySQL.\n\nIn Optuna, it is common to use the artifact module when you want to read and write such data for each trial. Unlike Scenario 1,\nwe distribute the optimization across computation nodes, so local file system-based backends will not work. Instead, we will use\nAWS S3, an online cloud storage service, and Boto3, a framework for interacting with it from Python. As of v3.3, Optuna has a\nbuilt-in artifact store with this Boto3 backend.\n\nThe flow of data is shown in Figure 3. The information calculated in each trial, which corresponds to the optimization history\n(excluding artifact information), is written to the MySQL server. On the other hand, the artifact information is written to AWS S3.\nAll workers conducting distributed optimization can read and write in parallel to each, and issues such as race conditions are\nautomatically resolved by Optuna's storage module and artifact module. As a result, although the actual data location changes\nbetween artifact information and non-artifact information (the former is in AWS S3, the latter is in the MySQL RDB), users can\nread and write data transparently. Translating the above process into simple pseudocode would look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.config import Config\nimport optuna\nfrom optuna.artifact import upload_artifact\nfrom optuna.artifact import download_artifact\nfrom optuna.artifact.boto3 import Boto3ArtifactStore\n\n\nartifact_store = Boto3ArtifactStore(\n    client=boto3.client(\n        \"s3\",\n        aws_access_key_id=os.environ[\n            \"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\"\n        ],  # Assume that these environment variables are set up properly. The same applies below.\n        aws_secret_access_key=os.environ[\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\"],\n        endpoint_url=os.environ[\"S3_ENDPOINT\"],\n        config=Config(connect_timeout=30, read_timeout=30),\n    ),\n    bucket_name=\"example_bucket\",\n)\n\n\ndef objective(trial: optuna.Trial) -> float:\n    ... = trial.suggest_float(\"x\", -10, 10)\n\n    # Creating and writing an artifact.\n    file_path = generate_example(...)  # This function returns some kind of file.\n    artifact_id = upload_artifact(\n        artifact_store=artifact_store,\n        file_path=file_path,\n        study_or_trial=trial,\n    )  # The return value is the artifact ID.\n    trial.set_user_attr(\n        \"artifact_id\", artifact_id\n    )  # Save the ID in RDB so that it can be referenced later.\n\n    return ...\n\n\nstudy = optuna.create_study(\n    study_name=\"test_study\",\n    storage=\"mysql://USER:PASS@localhost:3306/test\",  # Set the appropriate URL.\n)\nstudy.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)\n\n# Downloading artifacts associated with the best trial.\nbest_artifact_id = study.best_trial.user_attrs.get(\"artifact_id\")\ndownload_file_path = ...  # Set the path to save the downloaded artifact.\ndownload_artifact(\n    artifact_store=artifact_store, file_path=download_file_path, artifact_id=best_artifact_id\n)\nwith open(download_file_path, \"rb\") as f:\n    content = f.read().decode(\"utf-8\")\nprint(content)\n```\n## Example: Optimization of Chemical Structures\n\nIn this section, we introduce an example of optimizing chemical structure using Optuna by utilizing the artifact module. We will\ntarget relatively small structures, but the approach remains the same even for complex structures.\n\nConsider the process of a specific molecule adsorbing onto another substance. In this process, the ease of adsorption reaction\nchanges depending on the position of the adsorbing molecule to the substance it is adsorbed onto. The ease of adsorption reaction\ncan be evaluated by the adsorption energy (the difference between the energy of the system after adsorption and before). By\nformulating the problem as a minimization problem of an objective function that takes the positional relationship of the adsorbing\nmolecule as input and outputs the adsorption energy, this problem is solved as a black-box optimization problem.\n\nFirst, let's import the necessary modules and define some helper functions. You need to install the ASE library for handling\nchemical structures in addition to Optuna, so please install it with `pip install ase`.\n"
